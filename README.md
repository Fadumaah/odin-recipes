# odin-recipes

This is my first project with the odin project.

Where I will put all of the BASIC HTML knowledge I have into practise and build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main inex page which will have links to a few recipes. Currently this website will only have HTML as I have not started CSS but I will revist this in the future to improve the website.
